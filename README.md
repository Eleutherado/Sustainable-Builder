# Sustainable-Builder
This is a simple 2D game created in Python 3.4 with the Tkinter graphics library
I created it as a final project for my intro to programming class in 2015. The codebase isn't the cleanest but it works.

The Animation Class was provided by the Fall 2015 CMU 15-112 course, with some very minor edits.



### How to Run
Clone the repository, and run from the simulator.py (use python3.4)
