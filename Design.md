For my 15-112 term project I intend to build a simulator in which the user will have a character with food, water, energy  needs that must be met by gathering resources and then using them to buy other things to sustain the character’s life.

To simulate a day/night cycle I used a _Sine_ function taking into acount the day time which then edited a class attribute of ‘Drawn’ from which all the drawn things inherited, so then they could all update the rgb values for the colors.
